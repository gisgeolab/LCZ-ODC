# Pan-sharpening of PRISMA imagery

This Repository contains examples of pan-sharpening methods applied to hyperspectral PRISMA imagery[<sup>1</sup>](#1).

Python codes for pansharpening are provided in the `methods.py` file and accessible through the `Pansharpening.ipynb` Notebook. Functions were implemented in a GitHub Repo[<sup>2</sup>](#2) and are here adapted to the PRISMA imagery context. Metrics for pansharpening quality assessment are provided in the `metrics.py` file, adapted from a dedicated GitHub Repo[<sup>3</sup>](#3).

<ins>Note</ins>: a MATLAB Toolbox is also available for pansharpening of PRISMA data. This toolbox was developed in the context of the *2022 WHISPERS Hyperspectral Pansharpening Challenge*[<sup>4</sup>](#4).

Specifically, the methods implemented in this Repository are based on **Principal Component Analysis**, **Gram-Schmidt Decomposition**, and **Gram-Schmidt Adaptive**, which belong to the Component Substitution methods.
