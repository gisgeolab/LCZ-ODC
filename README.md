# LCZ-ODC Project (Local Climate Zones and Open Data Cube)

## Project description
The LCZ-ODC (Local Climate Zone - Open Data Cube) project aims to develop an innovative methodology for LCZ mapping by leveraging multiple data sources and state-of-the-art technologies for geospatial data management. The testbed selected for the activities is the Metropolitan City of Milan (northern Italy).

The main purpose of the LCZ-ODC project is the dentification of Local Climate Zones and study of their correlation with air temperature in the Metropolitan City of Milan through the integration of geospatial data and Earth Observation technologies in Open Data Cube Environment.
This project is developed in collaboration between **Italian Space Agency (ASI)** and **Politecnico di Milano, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (POLIMI DICA)**, in the context of I4DP_SCIENCE program.

### I4DP_SCIENCE Program
The LCZ ODC project is an integral part of the **I4DP_SCIENCE** program of ASI (Agenzia Spaziale Italiana, agreement n. 2022-30-HH.0). The program serves as an incubation platform to demonstrate, in collaboration with ASI, the operational use of scientifically and operationally mature methods and algorithms, equipped with credible performance/capacity. These methods and algorithms aim to address the needs of the user community that are currently partially satisfied or not yet fulfilled.

### LCZ-ODC Repository
This repository contains the code and information related to the Work Package 2 (WP2) - Development of the LCZ ODC project. It includes the ODC Docker container and the LCZ Processing Notebooks.
The **branches** in this repository allows to access to the code and the information related to WP2, organized as follow:

1. [Docker-ODC](https://github.com/gisgeolab/LCZ-ODC/tree/Docker-ODC)
    - This branch contains the ODC Docker container.
    - You can find documentation related to the ODC Docker setup and usage.
2. [Processing-Notebooks](https://github.com/gisgeolab/LCZ-ODC/tree/Processing-Notebooks)
    - This branch contains the notebooks used for data preprocessing and obtaining analysis-ready data.
    - You'll find notebooks for performing LCZ classification and validation.
    - Additionally, there are notebooks available for visualization and data analysis.

> :warning: NOTE: Additionaly, a QGIS plugin called ARPA Weather has been developed in the context of LCZ-ODC project, in order to retrieve ARPA Lombardia ground sensors. More informations are provided in the [ARPA Weather plugin Github repository](https://github.com/gisgeolab/ARPA_Weather_plugin).
